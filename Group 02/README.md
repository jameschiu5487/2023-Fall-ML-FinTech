* Project Motivation: Price and Volume Data-based Forecasting of Short-term Return in Bitcoin*

In the burgeoning field of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin stands as the pioneering digital asset, exhibiting substantial volatility and trading volume that captivate investors, traders, and researchers alike. The quest for understanding and predicting Bitcoin's price movements is not merely an academic exercise but a practical imperative for market participants who seek to optimize returns and hedge against market downturns. 

* Significance*

The significance of forecasting short-term returns in Bitcoin lies in its potential to unlock sophisticated trading strategies, enhance portfolio management, and contribute to the broader understanding of digital asset dynamics. Unlike traditional financial assets, Bitcoin's market is influenced by a unique blend of factors including technological changes, regulatory announcements, and sentiment-driven investor behavior, all of which manifest in its price and trading volume.

* Challenges*

However, the challenge is formidable. Bitcoin's price patterns defy many conventional financial theories, and its markets operate around the clock, generating vast amounts of data to process. The volatile nature of Bitcoin necessitates a forecasting model that can adapt rapidly to changing market conditions and capture the essence of short-term fluctuations rooted in both fundamental and speculative factors.
